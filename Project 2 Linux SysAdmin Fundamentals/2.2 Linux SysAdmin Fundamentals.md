## John the Ripper

In this lab, my senior administrator has asked me to audit the strength of users' passwords by using the `john` program and document any passwords that you find.

* A hash is a cryptographic function that takes data as input and translates it to a string of different, random-looking data.
* Password hashes are stored in the `shadow` file
* Password cracking tools cannot reverse a password hash. Instead, they use a wordlist of potential passwords and create hashes for each one.

After running the `sudo john shadow_copy` command I was able to crack Jack, Adam, Billy, Sally, and Max passwords' in the matter of minutes.

To prevent brute force attacks, it is recommended that users create long and complex passwords

## Sudo Wrestling 
Now that we know users had weak passwords, we want to make sure none of them have unauthorized `sudo` access. The next steps provided by your senior administrator have to do with locking access to the compromised system, including `sudo` access.

* `sudo -l` determines the privileges of a user
* I recorded the user's privileges in `~/research/sudo_access.txt`
* I discovered that the user `Max` has full access to `/usr/bin/less`. Having unrestricted access to `less` is a serious Linux security vulnerability, as it can be exploited to escalate privileges and gain root access

*   In the `visudo` file, I removed Max's unrestricted access.
