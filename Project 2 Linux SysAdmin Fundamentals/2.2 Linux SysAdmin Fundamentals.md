## John the Ripper

In this lab, my senior administrator has asked me to audit the strength of users' passwords by using the `john` program and document any passwords that you find.

* A hash is a cryptographic function that takes data as input and translates it to a string of different, random-looking data.
* Password hashes are stored in the `shadow` file
* Password cracking tools cannot reverse a password hash. Instead, they use a wordlist of potential passwords and create hashes for each one.

After running the `sudo john shadow_copy` command I was able to crack Jack, Adam, Billy, Sally, and Max passwords' in the matter of minutes.

To prevent brute force attacks, it is recommended that users create long and complex passwords

## Sudo Wrestling 
Now that we know users had weak passwords, we want to make sure none of them have unauthorized `sudo` access. The next steps provided by your senior administrator have to do with locking access to the compromised system, including `sudo` access.

* `sudo -l` determines the privileges of a user
* I recorded the user's privileges in `~/research/sudo_access.txt`
* I discovered that the user `Max` has full access to `/usr/bin/less`. Having unrestricted access to `less` is a serious Linux security vulnerability, as it can be exploited to escalate privileges and gain root access

*   In the `visudo` file, I removed Max's unrestricted access.

## Users and Groups
A sysadmin must know how to add and remove users to a system, add and remove groups, and add or remove users from groups.

The administrator has asked that we audit all the users and groups on the system, create a new group for the standard users, and remove users from the sudo group. In our previous activities we found some malicious users, and we will want to remove them from the system altogether. Your senior systems administrator has asked you to audit these groups and remove both unauthorized users as well as suspicious groups.

To complete these tasks, your senior administrator has asked that you do the following:


* Check every user's UID and GID.


* Make sure that only the sysadmin account is in the sudoers group.


* If you find a user that is part of the sudoers group, remove them from that group and document your findings.


* Remove any users from the system that should not be there.


* Verify that all non-admin users are part of the group developers. If the developers group doesn't exist, create it and add the users. We can use this group later to configure file-sharing among these users.


* The users adam, billy, sally, and max should only be members of the developers group and their own ("primary") groups. If you find any other groups, document the group and remove it.

* I recorded all users' UID, GID, and permissions into `~/research/user_ids.txt`
* I discovered that `jack` is a suspicious user because he is apart of the sudo group, in order to remove `jack` from the sudo group I used this command `sudo usermod -G jack jack` 
* I removed the user `jack` from the system using this command `sudo deluser --remove-home jack`
* I found a suspicious group called `hax0rs`, so I removed it using the command: `sudo delgroup hax0rs`
* I verifed that all non-admin users are part of the group `developers`
