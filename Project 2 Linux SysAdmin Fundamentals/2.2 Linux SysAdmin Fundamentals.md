## John the Ripper

In this lab, my senior administrator has asked me to audit the strength of users' passwords by using the `john` program and document any passwords that you find.

* A hash is a cryptographic function that takes data as input and translates it to a string of different, random-looking data.
* Password hashes are stored in the `shadow` file
* Password cracking tools cannot reverse a password hash. Instead, they use a wordlist of potential passwords and create hashes for each one.
