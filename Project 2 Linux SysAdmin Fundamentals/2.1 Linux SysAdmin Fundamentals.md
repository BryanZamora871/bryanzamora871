## Scenario
Investigate a malfunctioning Linux server reported to be running slower than usual. Identify suspicious activity on the system and then contain it.

Methodology will include: `Auditing processes` `Auditing files` `Installing security packages` `Configuring security services`

## Distribution Research
Ubuntu is highly adaptable and optimized for efficient daily operations and administrative management. Kali Linux is uniquely designed and optimized for penetration testers, providing a comprehensive set of tools for ethical hacking, security auditing, and vulnerability assessment. When setting up a web or data server, you have a variety of Linux distributions to choose from. While any of them could technically work, some are better suited for specific needs. Ubuntu Server and Fedora Server offer user-friendly tools and streamlined configurations for web services, making them ideal for those who prefer a more straightforward setup. On the other hand, if you're looking for greater control and don't mind handling configurations manually, Debian or CentOS would be solid choices.

| Central Data Server | Stores sensitive human resources data, so should use a secure distribution. Fedora and CentOS use SELinux by default, making them good choices. |
| :--- |:---:|
| Public Web Server | The public web server handles a large number of requests every day. It also doesn't need a GUI. Since the web server is central to business operations, it needs to run quickly. |
| IT Audit Workstation | The IT audit workstation is used for periodic assessments of network security. | 
| User Workstations | User workstations need a GUI and should include basic productivity software (such as LibreOffice and email clients). |

## Linux Landmarks
I will act as a junior Linux Systems administrator at Corp X.  A senior administrator has asked me to audit a malfunctioning Linux server. The senior system analyst advised that `Adam`, `Billy`, `Instructor`, `Jane`, `John`, `Max`, `Sally`, `Student`, and `Sysadmin` should be restricted to user accounts only

* The first step for troubleshooting any computer issue is gathering information. I will start with a basic audit of system files, exploring some of the most important locations in the file system to identify evidence of suspicious activity

* I have determined that the `auth.log` file, `Desktop` and `Downloads` directories, as well as the `/bin/cat` and `/bin/ps` files, are present.
* Upon inspecting the `/tmp` directory using the ls command, I identified a shell script named `str.sh`. This file appears to be out of place and warrants further analysis.
* I discovered that the jack and http directories are unfamiliar and potentially suspicious.

## Process Investigation

The `top` command list all the running processes in real time. 
*  The process that uses the most memory is `gnome-shell`
*  After reviewing all processes initiated by the `root` or `sysadmin` user, I discovered that `jack` is running processes on the system, despite not being authorized to do so. `jack` is running the stress-ng processes.

## Installing Packages
  Next, I took a static "snapshot" of all currently running processes, and save it to a file in my home directory with the name `currently_running_processes`. The command that was uesed was `ps aux >> ~/currently_running_processes` 
  In the short list, I noticed `jack` is running a process `stress0ng --matrix 0 --times`. These commands intentionally stress the system and consume resources, which could result in a Denial of Service from the server.

To terminate these malicious processes, I will need to execute the `kill` command to halt their activity and prevent further unauthorized operations. The command I ran was `sudo killall -u jack`
Now that I have stopped a malicious service from running and completed a basic audit, I will now install utilites on too my Virtual Machine. 
* `emacs` is a traditional file editor.
* `cowsay` cowsay is a utility that takes in input and displays a cow repeating it.
